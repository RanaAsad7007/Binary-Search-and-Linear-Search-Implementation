Purpose of the Code
This project implements two fundamental search algorithms: Binary Search and Linear Search. The objective is to practice core data structures and understand the concepts of searching.

Time Complexity
Linear Search: O(n) - In the worst case, the algorithm may need to check all n elements.

Binary Search: O(log n) - In the worst case, the algorithm continually divides the search space in half.

Printing Worst Case of Binary Search
The worst-case scenario for Binary Search is when the element is not present in the array. In this case, the algorithm will perform log₂(n) comparisons. For example, in an array of size 16, Binary Search will perform at most 4 comparisons (log₂(16) = 4).
